Miriam has always had a love for art and dance since she was young and continues
to fall in love with it the more she gets involved. She graduated with her

masters at university of Louisville. Miriam has worked with kids in the mental
health field for the past 3 years and has loved incorporating art into her
lessons. Miriam grew up in Charlestown and loves the idea of giving back to her
community in any way she can. She has experience with painting, drawing,
ceramics and multiple different styles of dance. She looks forward to teaching
art and movement classes to anyone who is wanting to experience them.
