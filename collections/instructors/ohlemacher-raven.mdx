Raven's passion for singing and music was ignited at a young age. Her formative
years were filled with singing and playing around the kitchen table with her
family to their favorite songs, which paved the way for a high school choral
career as Lead Soprano and soloist. She then went on to perform with the IU
Southeast Concert Choir and competed in the 2011 NATS competition. Today, she
spends her free time making music with her friends and performing vocals for our
Ensembles Community Jazz Band! Her guiding principle in vocal coaching is that
the voice is more than just a sound; it is the expression of who we are, what we
believe, and how we feel.
