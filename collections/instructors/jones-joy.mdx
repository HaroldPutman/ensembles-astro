Joy Jones is very excited to share her love of instrumental music with the Ensembles
community! She comes with 35 years of experience teaching band and instrumental music
classes to students of all grade levels. She is a graduate of Cedarville University with
a degree in music K-12. She has also completed many post-graduate level classes in
instrumental pedagogy, music theory, music technology, and jazz studies. She has a love
for music along with a passion to help students develop their gifts and talents. She is
especially proficient in helping young beginners turn a strange-looking instrument into
their new best friend! When she is not teaching, she loves being involved in church
activities, reading, performing in musical ensembles, and spending time with her family.
