For Amy-Kristin, visual arts, literature, and music brought vibrancy  
to a challenging childhood. As an adult, that vibrancy hasn’t dulled.  
She enjoys connecting with students from ages 3 to 103, and seeing their  
joy as they develop skills and are encouraged. Color and texture are  
evident throughout her artistic endeavors. From her personal art, to  
working as a Middle School Art teacher, costumer, set designer, freelance  
painting instructor, Master Sewist, and homeschooling, creativity is a  
vital part of it all. Amy-Kristin holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts with a  
focus in painting, drawing & interior architecture, a Minor in Art  
History, and a Masters in Art Education. She has interned and worked as  
a Master Artist for Kentucky Museum of Art & Craft (KMAC) in Louisville.  
Her personal mantra is: “Pray & create, Father God will lead.”
