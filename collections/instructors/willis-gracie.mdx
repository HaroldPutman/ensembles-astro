Gracie has been a part of the Southern Indiana music community for her whole
life, performing at many local farmers markets and showcases in the area over
the past 20 years. She has 10+ years of experience teaching ukulele and guitar
lessons and is passionate about sharing her love of music with others. She once
fundraised and donated 15 ukuleles and various percussion instruments to an
elderly end-of-life facility in Haiti, and spent 3 months there living with the
residents and teaching music. She is super excited for the opportunity to teach
in Charlestown, which she calls home with her husband and three year old
daughter.
