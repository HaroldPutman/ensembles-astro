Shannon Cunningham is no stranger to the stage, with over 30 staged performances. Some of 
her biggest roles range from Cat in the Hat in Seussical the Musical, to Penelope Toop in 
See How They Run, to Annelle in Steel Magnolias. She has been an Assistant Director and 
Choreography Coach for Southwestern Consolidated Schools as well as Shelby County Players. 
To keep her acting skills sharp, she regularly plays various roles with The Dinner Detective 
Louisville, and keeps her vocal skills up by serving as a vocalist in her local church, 
Southeast Christian Indiana—and would love to see you there sometime! When not singing or 
performing, Shannon is a full-time Licensed Clinical Social Worker with Talkspace and can be 
found spending time with her beloved friends and family—especially her awesome husband and 
son—reading, running (yes, for fun, haha!), or traveling.
