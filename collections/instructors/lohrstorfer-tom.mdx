Tom Lohrstorfer was born and raised on his mom's country music. At around age 12, he 
wanted to play guitar and learned the basics from his mom. Later, they put together a 
family band playing country and 60's to early 70's rock and roll at dances and clubs. 
During that time, and wanting to advance on guitar, he began his studies at Bob and 
Woody's School of Music under jazz guitarist Mike Mitchell.

Tom went into the ministry, and while there he and his wife Cindy introduced 
contemporary worship music at their church, adding it to the never-to-be-replaced 
hymns of the faith. Later, they did the same at another church, and with her singing 
they created a blended worship service as well. Currently, he enjoys playing bass 
guitar in his church's worship band in Memphis, Ind. He has been giving guitar lessons 
over the years and has added beginner ukulele and mandolin lessons as well.

Outside of music, his interests are first and foremost family, gardening, hiking, his 
church, and being a fairly good coffee connoisseur, as he does enjoy a very good cup of 
coffee "or 3".
