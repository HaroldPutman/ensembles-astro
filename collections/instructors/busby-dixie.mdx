Even after retiring from teaching art for 35 years, Dixie continued to
"substitute teach" at Silver Creek Middle School. As a member of
Charlestown's Beautification Committee, Dixie designed the city's bicentennial
logo among many other artistic contributions. She is looking forward to
working with students and families at Ensembles.
