Elora Andrews is a dedicated young violin teacher, with twelve years of playing
under her belt. She has been teaching young musicians for the last three years
and is passionate about instilling a love for music in her students. Her goals
for her students include being able to play in a group setting, being confident
in rhythm, being able to read music, having good tone, and having fun and
making friends along the way. She will be encouraging students to play by ear as
well, which will benefit them in other areas of life, not just violin.

Elora has had the opportunity to study under many wonderful teachers and was a
Suzuki student, therefore appreciating the classical approach to music. She was
also concertmaster of the Floyd County Youth Symphony Orchestra for several
years, as well as concertmaster in summer orchestras. In spare practice time,
she loves learning violin duets along with many other styles of music. She has
also played for her church, and loves any opportunity to play with others in her
community.
