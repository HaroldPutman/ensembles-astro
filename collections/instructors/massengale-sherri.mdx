Sherri Massengale has a passion for music. She is a classically trained pianist, but
enjoys all genres. Furthermore, Sherri has a passion for people. She is a mother of
twelve and a devoted people-lover. She loves to enhance people’s lives through
compassion, inspiration and meeting their needs, especially by meeting their needs of
connection and identity. Sherri currently plays piano for Fern Creek United Methodist
Church (FCUMC) in Louisville, KY (though she lives in Charlestown), plays keyboard in
their praise band, and directs their handbell choir. She also accompanies Silver Creek Jr
and Sr High Choirs. Sherri is excited about the opportunity now to also be part of
Ensembles!
