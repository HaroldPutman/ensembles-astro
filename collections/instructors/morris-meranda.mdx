experience working with students from a range of educational backgrounds.

In addition to her teaching and communication work, Meranda is a licensed practical
nurse with experience in patient education and wellness, informing her calm, safety-
minded, and age-appropriate approach to group instruction. Prior to nursing, she spent
ten years working in the restaurant industry and continues to work with food-based
projects at home and in group settings. Together, these experiences inform her approach

supervision, and enjoyment.

She also serves on the facilitator team at her church. Across all of her work, her goal is to
encourage confidence, kindness, and thoughtful communication in ways that feel
welcoming and supportive for students and families.
