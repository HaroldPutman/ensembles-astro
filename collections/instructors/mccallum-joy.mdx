Joy grew up in a theatrical home and had the privilege of working alongside her
mother, a musical theater educator with a Master’s degree in Drama, for many
years. She assisted with productions in community theaters, schools, and mystery
dinner theaters, and has performed in shows such as Grease and Camp Rock: The
Musical.

Joy has also taught drama in churches, co-ops, and schools, and truly enjoys
helping students discover their voices and build confidence on stage. She is a
mother of five and a homeschooling parent, which gives her a strong understanding
of both education and child development.
