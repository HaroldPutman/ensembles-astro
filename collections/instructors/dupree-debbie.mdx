Debbie has taught string instruments in Kentucky and Indiana for the last 30
years. In addition to violin, she also plays fiddle, guitar, mandolin, viola,
cello, upright bass, lap dulcimer and hammer dulcimer. She has always had a love
for teaching, to impart that wonderful gift of music to others, especially
children. She hopes to bring a great addition to Ensembles with her abilities in
"all things strings!"
