Jim Glueck has always enjoyed drawing and is known for "creative doodling"
through the years as most would say.

He and his wife, Patty are originally from Illinois and moved to Charlestown
three years ago to be closer to his daughter and grandchildren.

Jim is happily retired, and very active with his grandchildren! All his
grandkids enjoy drawing and his oldest granddaughter has gotten him back into
drawing!

Over the years Jim has created murals for clubs that he belonged to, airbrushed
many things including clothing. His grandchildren still wear pieces of art that
he has done 30 years ago!

Jim grew up with the classics in cartooning and looks forward to show students
why they were so popular back then, and the reason why they are still talked
about today.
