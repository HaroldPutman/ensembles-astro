Kelsey Allen is excited to work with the vocal students at Ensembles! She has been
singing her whole life, but started performing when she was 13 years old. Kelsey has
been teaching voice lessons since 2015 and truly enjoys investing in her students
and helping them grow into artists. She finds passion in not only teaching her
students how to sing, but also in giving them opportunities that help them grow into
artists and performers themselves, able to use what she has taught them to chart
their own course in music for years to come. Kelsey is very goal-oriented in her
lessons and wants her students to set goals for themselves too. She finds this to be
very motivating for her students and helps them to accomplish so much more
together. Kelsey is a wife to Daniel and a mom of 3. Outside of lessons, she enjoys
reading, being involved in her school’s PTO, and spending time with family. Kelsey
is excited to work with your children and hopes that she can help them to both see
and reach their potential.
