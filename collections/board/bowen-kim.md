Kim's school experience was greatly enhanced by band, choir and theater. She loved it all and got to travel and perform. Kim wants students to have the same opportunities she did. Originally from Madison, Indiana, Kim moved to Charlestown after marrying fellow board member, Frank. Through their son, they got involved in the school's band and theater. Their son has long since graduated, but Kim and Frank are still band boosters and Kim makes costumes for the band and theater because it is fun!

Kim believes Ensembles will be great for Charlestown. Music feeds the soul!
