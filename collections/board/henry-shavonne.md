Shavonne was raised on music in Charlestown. Throughout middle and high school, music was
her place to escape and grow. She now hopes she can share that community and expression with
others.

Shavonne also teaches privately through Songs of the Heart. She hopes that through Ensembles
and her private efforts, we can strengthen the musical community and build meaningful
friendships here in Charlestown.
