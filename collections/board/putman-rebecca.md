Rebecca is a 1985 graduate of Charlestown High School where she loved playing flute and being drum major of the Marching Band of Pirates! She was greatly influenced by her elementary music teacher Mary Ann Lesher and her piano teacher Pam Ballard, which prompted her to want to become a music teacher.

After getting her bachelor and master's degree in Music Education, Rebecca has enjoyed over 30 years of teaching. Knowing what music has given to her, she wants to break down any barriers from other students having the opportunity to learn and enjoy making music.

Ensembles has been a dream for a very long time. Music is for everyone and Rebecca's hope is that many from our community will take advantage and enjoy what Ensembles has to offer Charlestown.
