Harold describes himself as "an artist trapped in the body of an engineer". In his day job he is a software architect at a digital marketing agency. He has been an active band parent with two state champion bands in Lexington, KY. As a student he enjoyed played piano, guitar, and trumpet. Harold is a graduate of Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology where he studied Electrical Engineering.

Harold is excited to be working with his wife Rebecca to make this dream come true, and to support kids and adults as they enjoy the benefits of music and the arts.
