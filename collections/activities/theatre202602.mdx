In this class, students will work on basic acting techniques, participate in
light improvisation, and finish each session with fun skits. Our goal is to help
every student come out of their shell while developing strong performance skills.

This is a beginner’s class, but all experience levels are welcome. Parents are
encouraged to attend our final presentations.
