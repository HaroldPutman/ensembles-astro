This class is designed for students who already have some experience with guitar
and are looking to build on their existing skills. We’ll focus on advancing your
chord vocabulary, exploring more complex strumming patterns, and deepening your
understanding of music theory—all while learning new songs as a group. Bring your
own guitar, or let us know if you need to borrow one. The six-week session will
conclude with a group performance to showcase your progress.
