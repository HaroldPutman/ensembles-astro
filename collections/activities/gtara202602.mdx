Whether you're picking up a guitar for the first time or looking to sharpen your skills,
this group class welcomes players of all abilities. Students will work on chords, strumming
patterns, and basic music theory while learning popular songs together. Bring your own
guitar or let us know if you need to borrow one. The six-week session culminates in a group
performance.
