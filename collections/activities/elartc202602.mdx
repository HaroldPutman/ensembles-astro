This Elementary art class will focus on encouraging students to be hands-on, 
develop a deeper understanding of creativity and art, and have fun! Each session
begins with a zine making activity that will be the catch-all of sketches, thought
processes, and ideas.

Students will then dive into a relief paper based project, allowing them to
experiment with materials and textures. The second half of class will include a
guided lesson focused on foundational concepts such as color theory, drawing
techniques, art history, and trying new materials.
