Join us for the third of the 4-part women's Arts and Wellness Series: Gather.  
There is no cost, donations only, but registration is required because space is limited.

Each Gather morning is a sweet little retreat for your soul and includes:

- 🥐 A light breakfast
- 🎨 Art + music-based activities (no experience required!)
- 💬 Encouragement for caring for yourself and your heart during the winter months
- 🤍 A room full of wonderful women doing life together

Gather is brought to you in part through a generous grant from the [Greater North Clark Health Foundation](http://gnchf.com/home.aspx)
