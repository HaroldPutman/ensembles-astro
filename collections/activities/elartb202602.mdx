### Learning from the Masters

In this engaging homeschool art class, young artists will explore the world of
famous master artists while creating their own inspired works of art! Students
will study iconic artists such as Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso, Katsushika
Hokusai, Henri Matisse, Paul Cézanne, and Vincent van Gogh.

Through hands-on projects inspired by each artist, students will learn about
different styles, techniques, and art movements—while building confidence,
creativity, and a love for art. Each lesson encourages self-expression and
experimentation, making art approachable and fun for every skill level.

This class is perfect for elementary-aged homeschool students who love to
create, explore, and learn through art.
