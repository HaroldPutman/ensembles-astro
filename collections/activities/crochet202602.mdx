Discover the relaxing art of crochet in this welcoming and creative class! 
Whether you’re new to yarn crafts or looking to refresh your skills, you’ll 
learn everything you need to complete practical and fun projects like 
coasters and washcloths.

Guided step-by-step, you’ll become familiar with different yarns and hooks, 
master basic stitches (like chains and single crochet), and gain confidence 
in reading simple patterns. Along the way, you’ll build hand strength, 
improve hand-eye coordination, and make new friends as you create together in 
a supportive environment.

This course is designed to foster creativity and community—no experience 
required, just bring your curiosity and enthusiasm!
