Kindness Kitchen is a hands-on enrichment class focused on kindness, creativity, and
thoughtful giving through simple food-based projects. Each week, students learn how to
make or assemble a food item or pairing, creating one to enjoy themselves and one to
thoughtfully gift to someone else. Projects may include snack-style items as well as
simple food pairings designed for sharing and hospitality.

The class emphasizes learning through doing, with a focus on presentation,
personalization, and intention rather than advanced cooking skills. As the weeks progress,
students gradually build confidence through increased preparation, presentation, and
packaging, with projects evolving alongside the changing season and their themes.
Students explore color, seasonal themes, and packaging while learning how everyday
food can be prepared with care and shared in meaningful ways. Some elements are made
from scratch, while others may be pre-made to allow projects to fit comfortably within
class time. Content rotates each term, giving returning students a fresh experience each
session.

### Note for Parents

This is not a full cooking class. Projects focus on simple food preparation, pairing, and
presentation. Please list any food allergies or sensitivities during registration so
ingredients can be selected thoughtfully and safely.
