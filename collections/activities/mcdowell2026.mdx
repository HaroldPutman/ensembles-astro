## Find a new Pathway: Outside the lines

This is a free public art reception featuring pieces
from the [McDowell Center for the Blind](https://kcc.ky.gov/Vocational-Rehabilitation/seeking-services/CharlesMcDowellCenter/Pages/default.aspx).

Each piece tells a powerful story of creativity and resilience. Enjoy live music and light
refreshments while exploring the exhibition. At 7 PM, join us for a special presentation to
learn more about the artists and their work.

Visitors are encouraged to touch the art in this exhibit and experience it the way the artists do.

This event is open to everyone and suitable for families.
