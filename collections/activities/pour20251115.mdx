Discover the therapeutic and beautiful world of pour painting with local artist
Lisa Cymbalist, who found her own joy and healing through this unique art form.
In this hands-on workshop on November 8th from 2:00-3:30 PM, you'll learn to let go
and create a stunning masterpiece of your own, with all materials provided.

We are excited to open up this workshop for students that are 4th grade and above if
they have a parent with them. It will be a fun technique that will show the magic of
painting!
