Do you find yourself feeling panicky in lessons or on stage? This workshop is perfect for you! Led by
musician and board-certified music therapist Jenny Branson, this workshop will help you build
strategies and skills that are tailored to you and that will help you navigate performance anxiety. Join us
for this 6-week course that will not only give you strategies to help minimize performance anxiety, but
also give you an opportunity to put your new skills to work in a mini concert at the end of the series! 
Performance anxiety, or stage fright, is perhaps more common among professional musicians than you
might think. We’re here to help! We offer sessions given by a board-certified (MT-BC) music therapist
that will teach you the skills you need to manage performance anxiety.

SOME PERFORMING EXPERIENCE PREFERRED - COURSE RECOMMENDED FOR HIGH
SCHOOL OR OLDER

Please note that this is a 6-week course, all participants are expected to attend all 6 sessions, unless ill.
Participants should be prepared to commit to the entire series and to practice throughout the series to
build the skills needed to improve their performance skills!
